https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/


approach 01 : what we can do we will use two pointer to solve the problem, one we will have left pointer and one we will have right pointer 
right pointer will behave as advancing pointer.
left pointer will take care of the starting index of the substring.

we will traverse using right pointr, and check if character is present in left , righ-1 substring 
if yes :
maxi = max(maxi, count)
count = left -right
left = left +1
if No:
count++;

//HOW TO FIND CHARACTER IN STRING WITHIN GIVEN RANGE
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{

    string str = "nitishkamath";
    char ch = 't';
    int left = 0;
    int right = 2;
    int idx = find(str.begin() + left, str.begin() + right + 1, ch) - str.begin();
    if (idx != (right + 1 - left))
    {
        cout << "found @ " << idx << endl;
    }
    else
    {
        cout << "not found " << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}

approach 02 :
// ye question karke dil khus ho gaya
// what we can do we can use a map to store character and their frequency.
kisi bhi waqt, map ke andar wahi element present hoga which is substring as satisfied by the condition.
jab bhi end char ka freq 2  ho jaaye in that case we have to decrease frequency  starting from start untill end freq 1 na ho jaaye 
then we have to store max of (count, end - start + 1)
why end - start + 1 bcz as we have to store the length of substring possible.

note : you can ktake ordered as well as unordered_map .

class Solution
{
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string str)
    {
        map<char, int> mp;
        int count = 0;
        int start = 0;

        for (int end = 0; end < str.size(); end++)
        {
            mp[str[end]]++;

            while (mp[str[end]] > 1)
            {
                mp[str[start]]--;
                start++;
            }

            count = max(count, end - start + 1);
        }
        return count;
    }
};
