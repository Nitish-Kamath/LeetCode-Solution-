approach 01 :- using dfs , solution will be complex and may gives tle for few cases.


approach 02 : using Dp,( my approach)

for Being a square matrix, 
if we at top-left or bottom-right and move along row and col and diag and encounters 1 at all movement then it is square matrix.
for expansion of square matrix following condn must be satisfied :-

01. next diag element must be 1
02. must be adjacent
03. move along row  then we  must have 1 for all movement.
04. move along col  then we must have 1 for all movement.

Data Structure Required :-
01. matrix of dimension of  n + 1 and m + 1
02. variable named maxi -> take care of largest dimension possible till now

we will start filling from left to right for each row.

How to fill the t matrix :-
if we encounter 0 in org matrix then no expansion possible and fill the t with 0
if we encounter 1 in org matrix then take min of row, col and diag + 1(why 1 ? bcz. by inclusion of element 1 square matrix of dimension 1 is already psbl :)
