approach 01:-

what we can do, since we are traversing so in order to get depth we will take return type as int
and take max(left,right) + 1;
that it:

class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(TreeNode* root) {
    if(root == NULL)
        return 0;
        
        int left =  maxDepth(root -> left);
        int right = maxDepth(root -> right);
        
        return max(left,right) + 1;
        
       
    }
};
