sliding window maximum format

// two types of question possible  on sliding window
type01 : sliding window of fixed size
type02 : sliding window of variable size

concept :-
basically issme two pointer hota hai one is left and other is right pointer 
right- left + 1 = k(sliding window size)
// impt point ye hai ki if we have to find length then we take diff of two pointer and then add 1 to it.
int i = 0;
int j = 0;

while( j< nums.size())
{

calcn

if(j - i  + 1 == k)
{

ans <- calcn
remove calculation for removed element
i++;

}
j++;

}

// some impt point to be noted
total number of ans possible  = nums.size() + 1 - k
what is brute force calculation :- 
we are doing the operation for same element again and again.
for brute force code would run as :
for(int i = 0; i < nums.size() - (k -1) ; i++)
{
for(int j = i ; j < i + k; j++)
{
calcn on the same element.
}
}
